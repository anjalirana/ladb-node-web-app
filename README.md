# Ladb Web App - Node built

An web application built in node js to consume an API and to list races and players. (More of a practise I do daily in Node - I tried to get it working and spent whole day on it somehow managed not to work...) It is still worth having a look to see how I am going with Node Js.

- git clone <git-repo>

- cd <directory>

- npm init

- npm install

- nodemon server.js  --> You should now see app working at: `http://localhost:3030`
